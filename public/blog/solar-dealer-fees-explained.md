# Solar Loan "Dealer Fees" Explained: What That Low APR Really Costs

Many solar loans look affordable because the APR is bought down with a dealer fee. That fee often gets rolled into your loan—raising the financed amount (and total of payments), even when the headline APR looks great.

## Why This Matters

Some solar loans look affordable because the APR is bought down with a dealer fee. That fee often gets rolled into your loan—raising the financed amount (and total of payments), even when the headline APR looks great.

**The hidden truth:** You're financing thousands more for the same hardware just to get a lower APR. A plain-vanilla loan with a slightly higher rate but no fee might cost less over time.

## Quick Example (Illustrative Only)

| Item | Cash Purchase | Financed w/ Dealer Fee |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| System cash price | $28,000 | — |
| Dealer fee (embedded) | — | $10,000 |
| **Financed amount** (system + fees) | — | **$38,000** |
| APR / Term | — | 4.99% / 25 yrs |
| Est. monthly payment | — | ~$222 |
| **Total of payments** | — | **~$66,600** |

**Takeaway:** You're financing $10,000 more for the same hardware just to get a lower APR. A plain-vanilla loan with a slightly higher rate but no fee might cost less over time.

## How to Compare Apples to Apples

### Essential Questions to Ask

1. **Ask for the cash price and the financed amount** on the same proposal
2. **Request the APR, term, total of payments, and any fees** in writing
3. **If financed amount > cash price, ask:** What's the fee? Who gets it?
4. **Compare against a credit union or bank loan** with no embedded fees
5. **Use a spreadsheet** to compare total cost (not just monthly payment)

### Red Flags in Solar Financing

- **Financed amount significantly higher than cash price**
- **Refusal to explain the difference between cash and financed amounts**
- **"No fee" claims when financed amount exceeds cash price**
- **Pressure to sign financing documents quickly**

## Other Fine Print to Watch

### Payment Structure Issues
- **Payment escalators** (payments rise over time)
- **Promo paydowns** (requirements to pay a chunk within 12–18 months)
- **Prepayment rules** (any penalties or weird interest accrual)

### Legal and Administrative Concerns
- **Lien type** (PACE or UCC filing) and impact on selling/refinancing
- **Servicer transfers** (who handles your loan after closing)
- **Warranty assignments** and claim procedures

## Understanding Common Dealer Fee Structures

### How Dealer Fees Work
Solar companies often partner with specialized lenders who offer "dealer fees" as a way to buy down interest rates. Here's the typical process:

1. **Lender sets base rate** (e.g., 8.99% APR)
2. **Dealer pays fee upfront** to reduce rate (e.g., to 4.99%)
3. **Fee gets added to loan amount** you finance
4. **You pay the fee back over the loan term** with interest

### The Math That Matters
Even with a lower APR, you might pay more overall because:
- **Higher principal balance** due to embedded fees
- **Longer repayment period** on the fee amount
- **Compound interest** on the fee over the full loan term

## If You Suspect the Financing Was Misrepresented

### Immediate Actions
1. **Gather documentation:** proposal, final loan docs, and any emails/texts describing "no fees," "0%," or "free" solar
2. **Write to the lender and seller** asking for a complete fee breakdown and Good Faith itemization
3. **Document everything:** keep records of all communications and promises made

### File Complaints
- **State Attorney General:** Consumer protection violations
- **FTC:** Deceptive trade practices
- **CFPB:** Loan and servicing issues
- **Better Business Bureau:** Pattern of misleading practices

### Legal Consultation
Consult a lawyer about:
- **Deceptive trade practices** claims
- **Contract and warranty** violations
- **Truth in Lending Act** violations
- **State consumer protection** laws

1. "Can I finance this through my own bank or credit union?"
2. "How does that compare to your financing options?"
3. "Can you provide a side-by-side comparison?"
