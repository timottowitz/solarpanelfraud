## Red Flags of Solar Panel Financing Fraud in Texas

### High-Value System Financing ($35,000+)

If your solar panel system was financed for over $35,000 with terms spanning five or more years, you should examine your agreement closely. Many fraudulent companies inflate system values and use confusing financing terms to trap homeowners in unfavorable contracts that violate Texas consumer protection laws.

### Misleading Energy Savings Promises

Were you promised dramatic reductions in your electric bills that never materialized? Solar companies frequently exaggerate potential energy savings to justify expensive financing terms. Under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), these misrepresentations constitute fraud and may entitle you to compensation.

### False Tax Incentive Claims

Many victims are told they qualify for tax credits or government rebates that don't actually apply to their situation. This deceptive practice not only misleads consumers about true costs but may also violate federal and state consumer protection laws.

### Hidden Fees and Undisclosed Costs

Have you discovered unexpected monthly charges, penalties, or fees buried in your financing agreement? Texas law requires full disclosure of all terms and costs. Hidden fees may constitute a DTPA violation and grounds for legal action.

## The Rise of Solar Fraud in Texas

According to Texas Appleseed, solar-related complaints to the Texas Attorney General's Office increased by 818% from 2018 to 2023. Common fraudulent practices include:

- Forged signatures on financing documents
- Creation of bogus email accounts for digital signatures
- Falsified loan terms and interest rates
- Targeting elderly and non-English speaking homeowners

## Forced Arbitration: Not the End of Your Case

Many solar contracts include arbitration clauses requiring disputes to be resolved through AAA or JAMS rather than in court. While these agreements can seem restrictive, they don't prevent you from seeking justice. Experienced attorneys know how to navigate arbitration proceedings and still recover substantial compensation for victims.

The Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act provides powerful protections for consumers victimized by solar fraud. Violations can result in:

- Full refund of all payments made
