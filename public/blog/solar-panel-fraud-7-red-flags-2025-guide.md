## The 7 Critical Red Flags

### 1) "Act Today or Lose the Deal"

High-pressure sales ("this government program ends tonight") is a classic tell. Legitimate providers let you compare multiple quotes and sleep on the decision. **Real solar incentives have clear deadlines published by utilities or government agencies—not arbitrary sales deadlines.**

### 2) Verbal Promises That Vanish in the Contract

If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist. Make sure savings, production estimates, warranties, and timelines all appear in the final agreement—not just the pitch deck. **Salespeople who resist putting promises in writing are hiding something.**

### 3) Confusing or Missing Permits/Interconnection

Unpermitted or non-interconnected systems can't legally operate. Ask who pulls permits, who schedules inspections, and when you'll be permission-to-operate (PTO) ready. **A legitimate installer should clearly explain the permitting timeline and their responsibilities.**

### 4) A "$0" or "Free" System

There's no free solar. Verify the cash price, the financed price, and any embedded dealer fees used to buy down the APR. If the financed price is much higher than cash, ask why. **"Free" systems often hide inflated costs in complex financing arrangements.**

### 5) E-Signature You Didn't Control

Never let a salesperson create email accounts for you or "sign on your behalf." Insist on full visibility into every document you e-sign—and keep copies. **You should personally receive and review every document before signing.**

### 6) Mismatched Equipment or Bait-and-Switch

Your contract should list make, model, quantity, inverter type, racking, and monitoring. If the installer wants to swap gear, get a written change order with revised performance estimates. **Equipment substitutions without your written consent are red flags.**

### 7) The Disappearing Act

Ghosting right after installation is a major red flag—especially if you don't have PTO, production monitoring, or warranty registration. **Professional installers provide ongoing support and clear communication channels.**

## How to Vet a Company (Fast Checklist)

### Get Multiple Bids
- **3 bids minimum**: Compare system size (kW), production (kWh/yr), total price, and net present cost of financing
- **Apples-to-apples comparison**: Ensure similar equipment quality and warranties

### Verify Credentials
- **Licenses & track record**: Verify the electrical contractor license where required
- **Check complaints**: Scan your state AG, BBB, and local reviews
- **References**: Ask for two local customers you can call

### Technical Verification
- **Monitoring demo**: See the live app you'll use post-install
- **Insurance confirmation**: Verify liability coverage and workers' comp
- **Permit process**: Understand who handles what and when

## Financing: Questions That Protect You

Before signing any solar financing agreement, get clear answers to these critical questions:

1. **What is the cash price vs. the financed amount?**
2. **Are there dealer fees or "origination" charges embedded in the loan balance?**
3. **What's the APR, term, and total of payments?**
4. **Is there a payment step-up/escalator?**
5. **Does missing a "promotional" payment trigger retroactive interest?**

## If You Already Signed and Something Feels Off

Don't panic—you have options. Here's your action plan:

### Immediate Steps
1. **Collect everything**: proposals, contracts, loan docs, emails/texts, photos, utility bills before/after
2. **Check production**: compare monitoring output to the promised estimate
3. **Submit written requests**: ask for permits, PTO, final design, and warranty registrations

### Report the Problem
- **State attorney general**: File a consumer complaint
- **FTC**: Report deceptive practices
- **CFPB**: For loan and financing problems

### Get Legal Help
A consumer-protection lawyer can assess claims (deceptive practices, warranty/contract issues) and guide next steps, including arbitration if required.
