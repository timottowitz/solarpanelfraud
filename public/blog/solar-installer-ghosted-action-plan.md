## Why Solar Companies Ghost Customers

Unfortunately, disappearing after installation has become increasingly common in the solar industry. Common reasons include:

- **Financial troubles** - company running out of cash
- **Overwhelmed by complaints** - avoiding angry customers
- **Licensing issues** - regulatory problems forcing closure
- **Fraudulent operations** - never intended to provide ongoing support

**The key:** Acting quickly to protect yourself and your investment.

## Day 1–2: Secure Your Records

### Digital Documentation
- **Download contracts, loan agreements, permits, inspections, PTO letters**
- **Save all emails and texts** - list missed appointments and who said what
- **Screenshot the monitoring app** (or inverter screen) to document no/low production
- **Export warranty information** and registration details

### Physical Documentation
- **Photograph roof penetrations, flashing, wiring** and any damage or leaks
- **Document system nameplate information** (panels, inverters, model numbers)
- **Take pictures of electrical panels** and disconnect switches
- **Record system performance data** if accessible

> **Pro Tip:** Create a dedicated folder (digital and physical) for all solar-related documents. You'll need these for complaints, insurance claims, and potential legal action.

## Day 3: Demand Status—In Writing

### Send a Formal Demand Letter
Send a concise email to the installer and lender with:

- **Your project address, contract number, install date**
- **Outstanding items** (e.g., failed inspection, no PTO, roof leak, inverter fault)
- **A deadline** (5 business days) for response and a site visit
- **Request permit numbers, inspection results, and warranty registrations**

### Sample Email Template
```
Subject: URGENT - Project Completion Required [Your Address]

Dear [Company Name],

Project Details:
- Address: [Your Address]  
- Contract #: [Number]
- Install Date: [Date]

Outstanding Issues:
1. [List specific problems]
2. [System not producing power]
3. [Failed inspections]
4. [Roof leaks/damage]

I require a written response within 5 business days with:
- Status update on permit/inspection completion
- Schedule for system activation and repairs
- Warranty registration confirmation

Failure to respond will result in formal complaints to regulatory agencies.

[Your Name]
[Contact Information]
```

## Day 4: Call Your Utility & AHJ (City/County)

### Utility Company Contact
- **Confirm whether interconnection was submitted** and what's missing
- **Get status of Permission to Operate (PTO)** application
- **Ask about any failed inspections** or required corrections
- **Request reference numbers** for your records

### Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)
- **Check permit status** and inspection results
- **Get copies of failed inspection reports**
- **Understand correction requirements**
- **Confirm who can perform remedial work**

## Day 5: Notify the Lender/Servicer

### If You're Being Billed While System Can't Operate
Ask about:
- **Project non-completion procedures**
- **Installation defects policies**
- **Options to pause or dispute payments** pending completion
- **Where to send proof** (photos, failed inspection notes)

### Document Everything
- **Get representative names and employee IDs**
- **Request written confirmation** of any payment adjustments
- **Save all correspondence** for future reference

> **Important:** Even if payments are paused, continue documenting issues. [Understanding your financing terms](/blog/solar-dealer-fees-explained) is crucial during disputes.

## Day 6: File Formal Complaints

### State Level
- **State Attorney General** (consumer protection)
- **Licensing agency** (e.g., TDLR in Texas for solar-sales violations)
- **Public Utilities Commission** for interconnection issues

### Federal Level
- **FTC** (ReportFraud.ftc.gov)
- **CFPB** (consumerfinance.gov) for loan/servicer issues

### Local Resources
- **Local consumer affairs office**
- **Better Business Bureau**
- **City/county business licensing department**

*These filings build a paper trail and may prompt a response.*

## Day 7–8: Get a Second-Opinion Inspection

### Hire a Qualified Professional
Find a qualified PV professional or master electrician to:
- **Evaluate code compliance, wiring, grounding, rapid shutdown**
- **Assess roof penetrations** and weatherproofing
- **Check system performance** and monitoring
- **Provide a written report** with photos and remediation estimate

### What to Look For
- **Electrical code violations**
- **Improper roof mounting**
- **Missing safety equipment**
- **Poor workmanship**
- **System design flaws**

Share this report with the installer, lender, and (if needed) your insurance company.

## Day 9: Review Dispute Clauses

### Understanding Your Contract
Most contracts have mediation/arbitration steps. **Important:** This doesn't erase your rights; it sets the forum.

### Key Points to Note
- **Notice requirements** for disputes
- **Deadlines for filing claims**
- **Arbitration vs. court procedures**
- **Preservation of rights** requirements

### Don't Let Arbitration Clauses Intimidate You
- You can still file regulatory complaints
- Consumer protection laws may override arbitration
- Arbitration can be faster and less expensive than court

## Day 10: Talk to a Consumer-Protection Lawyer

### How an Attorney Can Help
- **Send a demand letter** (often required before suit)
- **Pursue deceptive practices claims**
- **Navigate warranty and contract violations**
- **Coordinate with regulators**
- **Handle arbitration or litigation**

### What to Bring
- **Complete timeline** of events
- **Inspection report** from Day 7-8
- **Photos and documentation** from Day 1-2
- **All correspondence** with company and lenders
