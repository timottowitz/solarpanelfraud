## The Perfect Storm: How Solar Fraud Exploded in Texas

### Post-Pandemic Vulnerability

The COVID-19 pandemic created ideal conditions for door-to-door solar scams. With more people working from home, sales agents found easy access to potential victims. The vulnerability was compounded by Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which exposed the fragility of Texas's power grid and made energy independence seem more appealing than ever.

### Targeting Vulnerable Populations

Analysis of over 1,000 complaints filed with the Texas Attorney General's Office reveals a disturbing pattern: fraudulent solar companies specifically target elderly, disabled, sick, and non-English speaking Texans. These vulnerable populations are viewed as "easy targets" for high-pressure sales tactics and deceptive practices.

## Common Types of Solar Fraud in Texas

### Misleading Tax Benefit Claims

Many victims report being deceived about federal and state tax incentives. Sales agents often exaggerate available credits or falsely claim homeowners qualify for rebates they're not eligible to receive, leading to unexpected tax liabilities and inflated system costs.

### False Energy Production Promises

Countless Texas homeowners have discovered their solar panels produce far less energy than promised. Some systems fail to work at all, while others generate only a fraction of projected savings, leaving families with both high electric bills and expensive solar loan payments.

### Shoddy Installation and Safety Violations

Poor workmanship has left many Texas homes with:
- Leaky roofs from improper mounting
- Holes in ceilings from careless installation
- Systems that fail local utility inspections
- Fire hazards from faulty electrical work

### Abandoned Customers

Perhaps most frustrating is when solar companies simply disappear, leaving customers with half-completed installations, no customer service, and no recourse. These "ghost" companies often operate under multiple names to avoid accountability.

## The Financial Devastation

### Massive Debt Burdens

Many victims find themselves trapped in 20-30 year financing agreements for systems worth far less than the loan amount. With interest rates often exceeding 8-10%, some homeowners will pay over $100,000 for systems actually worth $20,000-30,000.

### Property Liens and Credit Damage

Solar loans are typically secured by liens on the homeowner's property. When systems fail to perform as promised or companies abandon projects, homeowners face:
- Damaged credit scores
- Inability to sell or refinance their homes
- Potential foreclosure proceedings
- Thousands in additional costs for completion or removal

## Texas Legislative Response
