# Solar Panel Fraud Surge: How to Protect Your Home and Wallet from Rising Scams

A wave of complaints about rooftop solar promises that don't pencil out—from forged e-signatures to loans loaded with hidden markups—has put the fast-growing residential solar industry under a national microscope. Federal agencies and state attorneys general say deceptive sales pitches and confusing financing have trapped some homeowners in long-term debt for underperforming or non-functioning systems.

Most installers play by the rules, but the risks are real—and rising. Understanding these threats and knowing how to protect yourself has never been more critical for homeowners considering solar energy.

## The Scope: Complaints Are Climbing, Investigations Are Widening

### Federal Data Reveals Alarming Trends

Consumer complaints tied to "solar panels" filed with the Federal Trade Commission jumped to **5,331 by September 19, 2023—up 746% from 2018**. This dramatic increase reflects a crisis that extends far beyond isolated incidents.

Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warned in 2024 that some "solar-specific" loans come with "dealer fees" and markup costs that can add **30% or more** to a project. Marketing materials often misstate tax-credit impacts, leaving homeowners with unexpected financial burdens.

### State Attorneys General Take Action

On the ground, state attorneys general have launched aggressive enforcement actions:

**Connecticut's Legal Action:**
- Sued Sunrun and two partner firms
- Allegations include forged signatures, impersonation of consumers, and non-permitted, non-functional systems
- Companies dispute the allegations, but the case illustrates regulatory concerns

**Minnesota's Response:**
- Sued four large solar lenders
- Claims hidden fees misled homeowners
- Defendants deny wrongdoing, but the pattern concerns regulators

### Independent Market Data Confirms the Crisis

**EnergySage Findings:**
- In late 2023, the most common loan quoted carried fees averaging **47% of the cash price**
- These costs are often embedded to buy down attractive interest rates

**SolarReviews Data:**
- **1,000%+ increase** in 1-star reviews since 2018
- Rising dissatisfaction even as many customers remain satisfied with their systems

## Why Fraud Thrives Now

### Industry Growth Creates Vulnerabilities

Rooftop solar has scaled rapidly, becoming a mainstream home upgrade. That growth—and the complexity of financing and incentives—creates openings for bad actors, according to federal and state officials.

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Door-to-door sales blur lines between sellers, installers, and lenders
- Lead-generation funnels create confusion about company relationships
- E-signature workflows can be abused by unscrupulous salespeople
- Complex financing structures hide true costs from consumers

### Federal Coordination Response

The Treasury Department, CFPB, and FTC launched a joint effort in 2024 to coordinate enforcement and consumer education across the sector, recognizing the need for comprehensive federal action.

## A Lawyer's View from the Front Lines

Charles Bennett, a Texas trial lawyer at Bennett Legal who represents defrauded homeowners nationwide, says his firm's case reviews most often involve a familiar pattern:

### Common Fraud Patterns

1. **High-pressure pitches** with artificial urgency
2. **Misrepresented savings** that don't materialize
3. **Paperwork that doesn't match promises** made during sales
4. **Financing with dealer fees** that bloat the total price
5. **Alleged forged e-signatures** on loan documents
6. **Unpermitted installations** that fail inspections
7. **Systems that never pass inspection** or function properly

### Vulnerable Populations Targeted

Bennett notes these harms are not limited to any one state; they surface "wherever sales outpace oversight," and they disproportionately affect:
- **Senior citizens** targeted for their home equity
- **Non-English speakers** who struggle with complex contracts
- **Rural communities** with limited access to legal resources

## State Legislative Responses

### Texas Leads Consumer Protection Efforts

Texas enacted the Residential Solar Retailer Regulatory Act (SB 1036), providing comprehensive new protections:

**Key Provisions:**
- New oversight over residential solar sales
- Bans false claims of utility or government affiliation
- Creates complaint channels for contracts entered on or after September 1, 2025
- Registration requirements for sellers
- Enhanced penalties for deceptive practices

## How to Spot Trouble Before You Sign

### Red Flags to Watch For

**1. Pressure to Act Today**
Claims that a "government program" ends at midnight—or that only X homes qualify—are major red flags. Legitimate solar companies allow time for careful consideration.

**2. Savings That Erase Your Bill**
Some homes do cut bills dramatically, but promises of "$0 bill" or guaranteed profits are often marketing, not math. Always ask for production estimates and assumptions in writing.

**3. Financing with Hidden Costs**
Ask for the cash price and financed price side-by-side. Clarify any dealer fees baked into the loan balance. If fees buy down the APR, what's the true total cost?

**4. Verbal Promises vs. the Contract**
What counts is in the documents—warranties, performance guarantees, timelines, penalties for delays, and who fixes roof damage.

**5. E-signature Control Issues**
Never let a salesperson control your email or e-signature device. If they suggest creating an email for you, stop immediately.

## The Industry's Course Correction

### Legitimate Companies Raise Standards

Leading installers and trade groups say they're implementing reforms:

**Industry Improvements:**
- Cutting ties with questionable sales practices
- Creating co-ops that steer customers to lenders without hidden fees
- Piloting registries that track sales agents to prevent "bad actor" hop-scotching
- Federal Solar for All funding creating trusted provider lists for low-income households

These fixes won't eliminate disputes, but they may narrow the gaps where scams thrive.

## Bottom Line: Protection Through Knowledge

Rooftop solar can deliver real savings and resilience when done properly. But in a market this hot, consumer diligence matters more than ever.

### Essential Protection Steps

1. **Compare multiple quotes** from licensed installers
2. **Pressure-test all promises** with independent verification
3. **Treat financing as seriously as a mortgage**
4. **Remember: if a deal looks "free," assume costs are hiding somewhere**

### The Growing Crisis Demands Action

With solar fraud complaints increasing by 746% since 2018, homeowners need comprehensive protection strategies. Understanding your rights, recognizing red flags, and knowing where to turn for help are essential defenses against this growing threat.
