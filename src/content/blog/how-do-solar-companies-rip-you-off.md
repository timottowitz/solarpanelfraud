> Disclaimer: This article is informational, not legal advice. Allegations discussed are based on public reports as of 2025-09-24.

## Overview
We break down the most common “rip-off” patterns in residential solar — inflated pricing, financing games, contract fine print, and high-pressure tactics — with clear steps to protect yourself.

## Pricing & Anchoring Games
- Inflated $/W vs local market rates
- Bundling unnecessary add-ons to pad margins

## Financing Tricks
- “Dealer fees” buried in price
- 0% APR offers masking large fees
- Credit checks without clear consent

## Contract Fine Print
- Escalators, early termination, lien/UCC filings
- “Free solar” that isn’t free

## High-Pressure Sales Tactics
- Sign-now urgency, door-to-door pressure, misleading utility claims

## What To Do Next
Get 3 quotes, verify $/W, read the entire contract, and compare financing offers in writing. If you believe you’ve been misled, document everything and review our guides on [solar financing traps](/blog/solar-financing-scams) and [how to file complaints](/blog/complaints-against-solar-companies).
