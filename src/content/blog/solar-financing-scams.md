## Key Points
- Red flags and how to respond

- Where to report concerns

## What To Do Next
If you believe you were misled or harmed, document everything (contracts, communications, invoices) and consider filing complaints with your state consumer protection agencies or consulting qualified counsel.

## FAQ

### Do solar loans show on my credit report?
Many do. Always ask how the lender reports and what happens if a project is delayed. Monitor your credit and dispute unauthorized pulls.

### What are “dealer fees” in solar financing?
Dealer fees are costs embedded in loan pricing. A low APR can still cost more overall if dealer fees are high. Compare the total cost, not just APR.

### Can I exit a bad solar financing agreement?
It depends on your contract. Consult a [solar contract lawyer](/blog/solar-contract-lawyer) to review termination, rescission, or dispute options.
