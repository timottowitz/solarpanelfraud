# How to Sue a Solar Company — Finding an Attorney

> Disclaimer: This article is informational, not legal advice. Allegations discussed are based on public reports as of 2025-09-24.

## Overview
When to consider legal action, how to choose counsel, and expected steps. Not legal advice.

## Key Points
- Red flags and how to respond
- How to verify offers and companies
- Where to report concerns

## What To Do Next
If you believe you were misled or harmed, document everything (contracts, communications, invoices) and consider filing complaints with your state consumer protection agencies or consulting qualified counsel.

## FAQ

### Do I need a solar panel lawyer or a general consumer attorney?
Look for consumer protection, construction, or contract law experience. For financing issues, a lawyer familiar with lending disputes is helpful.

### Can I sue if my installer ghosted me?
Possibly. Document delays, damages, and breach. An attorney can advise on demand letters, arbitration, or court options.

### Is a class action better than an individual case?
It depends. Class actions fit widespread, similar harms; individual claims may be faster for specific damages. Get a consultation to decide.
