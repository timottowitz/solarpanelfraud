## FAQ

### How do solar companies rip you off?
Common tactics include inflated pricing, hidden dealer fees, misleading “free solar” claims, and high‑pressure sales. Always get multiple quotes and compare terms.

### Are “free solar panels” real?
Usually no. Most “free” offers are leases/PPAs with long commitments. Verify any program via official state resources.

### Who do I report a solar scam to?
File with your state Attorney General, contractor licensing board, and the FTC. See [how to file complaints](/blog/complaints-against-solar-companies).
